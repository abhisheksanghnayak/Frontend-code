<h1>Web browser</h1>
<p>A web browser, often shortened to browser, is an application for accessing web pages and navigating the Internet. When a user visits a website, the browser requests the web page from a web server and displays it. Browsers can also be used to access web pages hosted on the local filesystem (often called localhost) or network configuration pages.</p>
